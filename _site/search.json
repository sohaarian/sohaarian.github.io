    "text": "AI and originality\nThis week, I learned how AI can enhance learning without replacing original thought. AI is beneficial for me when used as a support tool for understanding concepts, while originality comes from how ideas are interpreted and communicated by me. I use AI to help me study! For example,it is beneficial for me to break down difficult concepts so that I can understand them in more simple terms and real-world scenario examples."
